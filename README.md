â€¢ I started the report creation by some required cleaning and transformation that included assigning correct data types, filling Missing values, changing the format of Date attribute in Orders table, Merged 2 tables.
â€¢ Modeled the data by re-establishing the relationships between couple of table which was not optimized for efficient filtering, configured cardinality among them and managed active-inactive relationships.
â€¢ Created Custom Date table with Hierarchy and incorporated in the model for drill down analysis
â€¢ Used Star schema to simplify analysis and created Custom columns and Measures using DAX that can be used in Charts, Visuals and KPIs as per requirement.
â€¢ Incorporated visuals that are best suited to display the distributions and trends based on the slicers of different parameters.

There was a timeline to complete the task hence only prioritized representing all visuals and KPIs which was required for analysis and insights over the Aesthetics and other Powerful features that Power BI provides to make the report more appealing. Hence there is still a scope of improvement in overall representation of the report pages including Color Coordination and Limiting the Visuals in a page.
